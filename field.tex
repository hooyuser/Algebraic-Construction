\dfn{Field}{
    A \textbf{field} is a commutative ring $K$ such that $K^{\times}=K-\{0\}$.
}
\prop{}{
    If $K$ is a field, $R$a ring homomorphism $f:K\to R$.
}
\dfn{Field Extension}{
    Let $K$ be a field and $L$ be a commutative ring. 
}

\lemm{Zariski's Lemma}{
    If a field is a finite-type $K$-algebra, then it is a finite extension of $K$ (that is, it is also finitely generated as a $K$-linear space).
}

\thm{Hilbert's Weak Nullstellensatz}{
    If $\overline{\Bbbk}$ is an algebraically closed field, then the maximal ideals of $\overline{\Bbbk}\left[x_1, \cdots, x_n\right]$ are precisely those ideals of the form $\left(x_1-a_1, \cdots, x_n-a_{n}\right)$, where $a_i\in \overline{\Bbbk}$. 
}

\thm{Hilbert's Nullstellensatz}{
    If $\Bbbk$ is any field and $\mathfrak{m}$ is a maximal ideal of $\Bbbk\left[x_1, \ldots, x_n\right]$, then $\Bbbk\left[x_1, \ldots, x_n\right]/\mathfrak{m}$ is a finite extension of $\Bbbk$.
